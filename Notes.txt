- Typescript has been enabled (for now just treat like standard js code but use file type .ts)
- JSX support enabled
- Vue router enabled (will allow smooth movement beween webpages and possibly transitions)
- Pinia enabled (basically allows you to create project-level global variables and methods of sort which can be acccessed from any component)
- Vitest enabled (probably won't need it but could be useful?)
- ESLint enabled (locates and occasionally fixes code issues)
- Prettier enabled and extension installed (automatically formats code on save)
- The .vscode directory in the root directory contains cusomized settings for this speciffic project for the vscode prettier extension

Todo:
- Install all relevant packages - remeber to navigate to correct folder before installation (plotly.js, plotly.js-basic-dist, @clalarco/vue3-plotly)
- Clean code (i.e. purge redundant vue components, etc.)
- Create UI skeleton (navbar, etc.)
    - Configure with vue router (https://router.vuejs.org/guide/)
- Webpage transitions (@keyframes)

Other notes:
- Create custom vue component for each task??
